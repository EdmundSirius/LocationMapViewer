#LocationMapViewer bookmarks

LocationMapViewer can store the current latitude/longitude/zoomlevel as named **bookmark**.

Similar to a web browser you can return to any bookmarked latitude/longitude/zoomlevel
by selecting it-s name.

From the [map view](map) you reach the bookmarks by pressing the
